Different request from user: Food. Check if that happens more than maybe incorporate, otherwise not relevant: times user request food: 3
Suppose you get stuck in the loop and you end up in the recommendation part where you don't have the price range, just the area and the type of food, is the system then able to to recommend a restaurant?
Should we also make our system clever in the sense that when we get a invalid answer a couple of times  the system asks: so any type of area/food/price range then?
How to handle don't care of doesn't matter answers? Because in some dialogues the system asks the question again and in other it just gives a recommendation",
